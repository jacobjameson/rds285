1. Construct this decision-analytic model in TreeAge (or another software package) using the information provided in the paper.

2. Calculate the life expectancy for each strategy for at least one of the age/gender groups. Note: for background mortality, use the 2018 US life tables. These are published by the National Center for Health Statistics:

- Go to https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/life_tables.html

- Click on the pdf link for the "United States Life Tables, 2020" (NVSR Volume 71,
Number 1)

- On pages 17 and 19 in this document (Tables 2 and 3, top of page) there are links to download 2020 life tables for men and women respectively.

- In these spreadsheets, the first column (qx) provides annual mortality probabilities.


3. Compare your results with those shown in Table 3 of the paper, and discuss potential
reasons for any discrepancies (besides the different life tables).


4. Perform one-way sensitivity analysis on 2 of the key variables.
