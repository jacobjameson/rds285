### Decision Problem 

You must decide whether or not to implement a screening program for Latent Viral Disease 
(LVD), a potentially fatal (and hypothetical) illness. Assume that persons testing positive will be 
treated, which prolongs their life expectancy. For individuals with LVD who are not screened, 
assume that treatment will be delayed and the survival advantage is less than those who 
receive early treatment. For individuals without LVD who get inappropriately treated, there is a 
decrease in life expectancy due to drug toxicity. The screening test is imperfect with a 
sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.95. The prevalence of LVD in this population is 2%. The 
objective is to maximize life expectancy. The decision tree is shown in the figure below.
