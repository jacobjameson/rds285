### Markov Models


(a) Write down a transition probability matrix for this Markov chain. 
 
 
(b) How many cycles must elapse by the time Â³ 25% of the population is dead? Show all hand 
calculations using matrix algebra (you may use TreeAge software or Excel to check your 
calculations). 
 
 

(c) For persons who are ill, what is the 5-year survival probability?  [Hint: consider your 
starting population]
